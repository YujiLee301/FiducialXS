  This YAML file contains list of observables for which we should run the current framework.
  Here, the section and sub-section name (i.e. "Observables" and "1D_Observables") is hardcoded
  in the python file "RunEverything.py". So, one should not change these two names.
Observables:

  1D_Observables:

    pT4l:
     bins: "|0|10|20|30|45|60|80|120|200|13000|"
     label: "p_{T}(H)"
     unit: "GeV"
     gen: "GENpT4l"
     ifAbs: False
     ifJES: False
